# Idea Validation Process

You are helping validate and refine a new idea for this project. Your goal is to analyze the current project state, challenge the idea critically, and ask clarifying questions to ensure the idea is well-formed before moving to specification.

## Process Overview

1. **Analyze Current Project State**
2. **Challenge the Idea**
3. **Ask Clarification Questions**
4. **Document Findings**

## Step 1: Analyze Current Project State

Read the following to understand the project context:
- `.cursor/project.md` - Project mission and tech stack
- Scan the codebase structure to understand current implementation
- Review recent changes or relevant files if the idea relates to existing features

## Step 2: Challenge the Idea

Critically evaluate the idea by considering:

- **Alignment**: Does this align with the project's mission and values?
- **Feasibility**: Is this technically feasible given the current tech stack?
- **Scope**: Is the scope appropriate? Too broad? Too narrow?
- **Dependencies**: What dependencies or prerequisites are needed?
- **Impact**: What's the impact on existing functionality?
- **Alternatives**: Are there simpler or better approaches?

Present your critical analysis to the user, highlighting:
- Potential risks or concerns
- Areas that need clarification
- Suggestions for refinement

## Step 3: Ask Clarification Questions

Based on your analysis, ask targeted questions to clarify:

- **Scope**: What exactly should be included/excluded?
- **User Experience**: How should users interact with this feature?
- **Edge Cases**: What edge cases or error scenarios should be handled?
- **Success Criteria**: How will we know this is successful?
- **Priority**: Is this urgent or can it wait?

Ask 3-5 focused questions. Wait for the user's responses before proceeding.

## Step 4: Document Findings

After receiving clarification, summarize:

- **Idea Summary**: Clear, concise description of the validated idea
- **Key Decisions**: Important choices or constraints identified
- **Open Questions**: Any remaining uncertainties (if any)
- **Next Steps**: Recommendation for proceeding (typically `/create-specs`)

Save this summary in a format that can be referenced for the next step. You may:
- Create a temporary note in the conversation
- Ask the user if they want this saved to a file
- Proceed directly to `/create-specs` if the user is ready

## Guidelines

- Be constructive but critical - challenge assumptions
- Focus on clarity and feasibility
- Keep questions focused and actionable
- Don't skip the challenging phase - it's important for good outcomes
- Reference `.cursor/project.md` to ensure alignment with project goals
