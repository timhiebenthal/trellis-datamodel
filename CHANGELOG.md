## [0.1.5] - 2025-12-06

### Fixed
- Fixed relationship persistence to dbt schema.yml files - relationships now correctly use bound dbt model names instead of entity IDs when writing relationship tests
- Fixed relationship auto-inference from existing dbt tests - adapter now properly loads config and maps model names (including additional_models) to entity IDs
- Fixed adapter factory to use live config values instead of stale module-level constants, ensuring inference works after config is loaded

### Added
- Added regression tests for relationship sync and inference, including support for additional_models and bound/unbound entities

## [0.1.4] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- Fixed frontend API calls to use relative URL (`/api`) instead of hardcoded `localhost:8000`, allowing the app to work on any port
- Improved CLI error message to show full expected path when trellis.yml is not found

## [0.1.3] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- Fixed config-status API endpoint to use CONFIG_PATH from startup instead of re-searching from current working directory

## [0.1.2] - 2025-12-05

### Fixed
- Fixed frontend error message to correctly display "Missing `trellis.yml`" instead of "Missing `config.yml`"
- Updated `/api/config-status` endpoint to use `CONFIG_PATH` set at server startup instead of re-checking `os.getcwd()` at request time
- Added `config_filename` field to config status API response to dynamically show the expected config file name

## [0.1.1] - 2025-12-04

- Updated Readme
