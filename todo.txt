I need your help with the following problem:

The relationships are kinda broken
If I refresh the page, rename an entity or simple drag an relation between two entities
sometimes 2 or 3 new relations pop up

can you investigate the issue, identify the problem and propose a solution.
also, feel free to suggest better, more robust ways of handling relationship-building between entities
